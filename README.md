# dailyStatus
Holds code to create a custom daily status using my file system

This code is used to generate a new daily status based on the previous daily status
It copies the previous DS goals for the day and pastes it in a new file with updated dates in the completed yesterday section

This is my first ruby program that actually does something somewhat useful
